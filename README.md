## Description
This function will Compare the execution time of two or more files on the
 Same system, for their speed of execution comparison.
 It will help in understanding the execution speed comparison of different Files.

Author: Kvc

## Usage
Call AnC [FilePath1] [FilePath2] [FilePath3] [...]

Where:

- `ver`		: 	Displays version of program
- `help`		: 	Displays help for the program
- `FilePath1`	: 	Path of File1
- `FilePath2`	: 	Path of File2
- `FilePath3`	: 	Path of File3
- `...`    :    More Files

Example: 
`call AnC "Button-1-Test.bat" "D:\Button-2-Test.bat"`

## Demonstration:


To demonstrate the AnC plugin we have selected two files to compare and find out which one is faster and by how much.

For the first file, we have an example of the Gecho plugin. In this example, I have displayed different types of messages that can be printed using the Gecho plugin.

As for the second file, we have an example of the progress bar plugin. I have displayed a progress bar starting from1 and maximum progress of 30 with a width of 77.

Now for the comparison of the above two files using the AnC plugin. As shown below the Gechoexammple.bat file takes an average time of 75ms compilated. Which is faster than the ProgressTest.bat file which takes an average time of 477ms compilated by 6 times.
